# Github Profile Project
nanodegree github profile project

## Overview
GitHub Profiles are a key piece of "evidence" to an employer that you'd be a good job candidate, because they can see the details of your work. Recruiters use GitHub as a way to find job candidates, and many Nanodegree alumni have received work opportunities from their activity on GitHub. In addition, using GitHub is a way for you to collaborate on projects with other programmers - this will show that you are able to work well with others on an engineering team on the job.
## Instructions
Submit this project after you've done some continuous coding for two weeks, so the reviewer will be able to comment on trends.
